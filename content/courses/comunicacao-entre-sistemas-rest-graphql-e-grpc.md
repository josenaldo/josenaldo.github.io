In this course, I learned how to design and implement communication between distributed systems using REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. The course covered RESTful API principles and best practices, designing and documenting APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger, GraphQL schema design with queries, mutations and subscriptions, Protocol Buffers and gRPC services implementation, choosing the right protocol for different scenarios, API gateways and protocol translation, and authentication/security patterns. I also learned testing and debugging strategies for each protocol, performance considerations, and how to deploy and monitor microservices communication with logging, tracing, and resiliency patterns.
