In this course, I learned the five SOLID principles for writing maintainable and scalable object-oriented code. The course covered the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for focused classes, Open/Closed Principle (OCP) for designing software open for extension but closed for modification, Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) for proper subtype behavior, Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) for creating small and focused interfaces, and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) for inverting dependencies between high-level and low-level modules. I practiced identifying anti-patterns, refactoring legacy code to follow SOLID principles, and applying all principles together in integrated examples with before-and-after code comparisons.
