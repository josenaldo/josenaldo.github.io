In this course, I learned:

- **Revisiting Classes and Objects**: Understanding object-oriented concepts, initializing objects, adding attributes and methods, encapsulating behavior, and using properties.
- **Removing Duplication with Inheritance**: Exploring inheritance, reducing code duplication, reusing and extending classes, and understanding the advantages of inheritance.
- **Reducing Ifs with Polymorphism**: Applying polymorphism to simplify conditional logic, enhancing object representation, and using `__str__` for textual output.
- **When Not to Use Inheritance**: Identifying cases where inheritance increases complexity, understanding its drawbacks, and considering alternative approaches.
- **Duck Typing and Data Models**: Implementing Duck Typing, protected attributes, iterable advantages, Python’s data model, abstract base classes (ABCs), and composition vs. extension.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Managing multiple parent classes, resolving method conflicts, understanding mixins, and exploring the pros and cons of multiple inheritance.
