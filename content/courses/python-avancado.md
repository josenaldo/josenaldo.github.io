In this learning path, I completed several advanced Python courses covering professional development practices. The course covered automated testing with unittest and pytest, implementing test-driven development (TDD) methodology, design patterns in Python (Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns), advanced I/O operations (file handling, streams, context managers), following PEP 8 style guide and Python best practices, error handling and exception management, debugging techniques and tools, working with different file formats and data serialization, and writing clean, maintainable, and Pythonic code. I learned how to structure larger Python projects, apply SOLID principles in Python, use decorators and metaclasses, and implement professional-grade error handling strategies.
