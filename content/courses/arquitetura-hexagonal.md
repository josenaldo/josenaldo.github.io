In this course, I learned how to build scalable and maintainable software using Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters pattern). The course covered decoupling business logic from infrastructure, implementing ports and adapters, organizing code by layers, and applying Domain-Driven Design concepts like Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, and Repositories. I practiced structuring applications with clear boundaries, implementing use cases, building web and persistence adapters, and applying TDD/BDD testing strategies while integrating with frameworks like Spring Boot and Docker.
