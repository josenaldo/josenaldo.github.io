In this course, I learned how to facilitate Event Storming workshops for collaborative domain modeling. The course covered the Event Storming process step-by-step, including identifying domain events, commands, and aggregates using sticky notes, facilitating collaborative sessions with business and technical teams, uncovering processes and business rules, and identifying bounded contexts. I also learned how to translate Event Storming results into software designs, connect with Domain-Driven Design concepts, map outcomes to microservices boundaries, and integrate with event-driven architectures using tools like RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka.
