In this course, I learned:

- **Introduction to Test Doubles**: Understanding TDD, designing book consultation tests, and why test doubles are useful.
- **Using Test Doubles**: Applying test doubles for HTTP requests, understanding `Stub`, and handling exceptions with `unittest.mock`.
- **Capturing Indirect Outputs**: Testing function calls, verifying directory and file creation, using `Spy`, and ensuring correct write operations.
- **Programming Expected Behavior and Verifying Inputs**: Exploring the `Mock` double, testing repeated requests and responses, handling errors in API calls, and logging failures.
- **Handling Errors and Dependencies**: Testing failures on the first page of results, dealing with unavailable components, and verifying database insertions.
- **Using `Fake` Doubles**: Implementing `Fake` test doubles with and without `unittest.mock` and testing data persistence.
- **Final Project and Conclusion**: Applying test doubles in real-world scenarios.
