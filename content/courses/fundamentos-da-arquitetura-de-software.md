In this course, I learned the fundamentals of software architecture for designing and building robust applications. The course covered the importance and role of software architecture, architectural patterns and styles (layered, microservices, event-driven, monolithic), core principles like SOLID, DRY, coupling and cohesion, designing for scalability, performance, maintainability, and resilience, Domain-Driven Design fundamentals, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and API design, handling legacy systems and managing technical debt, and documenting and diagramming architectures with industry-standard tools. I also studied real-world case studies and learned how to make architectural decisions that balance business needs with technical constraints.
