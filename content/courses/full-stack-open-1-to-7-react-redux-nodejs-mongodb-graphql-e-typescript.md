In this comprehensive course, I learned modern full-stack web development with React, Node.js, and related technologies. The course covered fundamentals of web apps and React (components, props, state, hooks, event handling), communicating with servers and REST APIs, server programming with Node.js and Express (CRUD operations, middleware, routing), automated testing of frontend and backend with Jest, Vitest, Cypress, and Playwright, advanced state management with Redux Toolkit, React with TypeScript for type-safe development, authentication and security with JWT and bcrypt, GraphQL for building and consuming APIs, and DevOps with Docker, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD. I also learned database management with MongoDB/Mongoose and PostgreSQL, deployed applications to render.com and fly.io, and completed extensive project-based assignments that mimic real-world full-stack development.
