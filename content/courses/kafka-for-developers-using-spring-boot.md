In this course, I learned how to integrate Apache Kafka into Java/Spring Boot applications for building event-driven microservices. The course covered Kafka fundamentals (topics, brokers, producers, consumers, partitions, offsets), setting up Kafka with Spring Boot and configuring Spring Kafka dependencies, writing producer code to publish events and building consumer components to subscribe and read messages, handling serialization/deserialization with JSON and Avro, Kafka Streams API for real-time event processing, error handling with retries and dead-letter topics, implementing transactions and exactly-once delivery semantics, and testing Kafka applications with embedded Kafka. I also learned security best practices with SSL/SASL and how to tune and monitor Kafka applications.
