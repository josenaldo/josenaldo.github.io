In this course, I learned:

- **The Problem with the Procedural Paradigm**: The differences between procedural and object-oriented programming, the concept of data and behavior, and the initial steps of an object-oriented project.
- **Classes and Objects**: How to define classes and objects, create constructors, assign default values to attributes, and access class attributes.
- **Implementing Methods**: How to define and use methods, improve class behavior, understand None and garbage collection, and specify a class's responsibilities.
- **Encapsulation**: The importance of private attributes, the use of double underscores (\_\_), the benefits of encapsulation, and the principles of cohesion in object-oriented programming.
- **Using Properties**: How to create and use getters and setters, improve access to private attributes, and implement properties for better data control.
- **Private and Static Methods**: The role of private and static methods, their syntax, when to use them, and the differences between object-oriented programming in Python and Java.
