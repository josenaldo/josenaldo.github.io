In this course, I learned the fundamentals of Domain Driven Design for building software that reflects business complexity. The course covered the importance of Ubiquitous Language for team communication, identifying Domains, Subdomains, and Bounded Contexts, strategic design patterns including Context Maps and integration patterns (Partnership, Shared Kernel, Customer/Supplier, Anticorruption Layer), tactical design with Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, and Repositories, and how to integrate DDD with modern architectures like microservices, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. I also learned Event Storming for collaborative modeling, layered architecture patterns, and common mistakes to avoid when implementing DDD in real-world projects.
