In this course, I learned tactical Domain-Driven Design patterns for building complex, scalable systems. The course covered Entities and Value Objects, Aggregates and Aggregate Roots, Domain Services for stateless operations, Repositories for persistence abstraction, Domain Events for representing business occurrences, Bounded Contexts for managing complexity, and Factories for encapsulating object creation. I also learned how to implement Hexagonal Architecture, apply the Anti-Corruption Layer pattern for legacy integration, and use CQRS for separating read and write responsibilities. The course included hands-on exercises building real scenarios like e-commerce systems with proper domain modeling.
