In this course, I learned:

- **Introduction to Exceptions**: Understanding `AttributeError`, identifying exceptions, forcing errors, using `try` and `except`, and handling errors.
- **Propagation and Raising Exceptions**: Handling multiple `except` blocks, using `raise`, and understanding exception flow.
- **Arguments and Aliases**: Simulating private attributes, encapsulating assignments, and working with exception arguments.
- **Debugging via Command Line**: Using the debugger to analyze and fix exceptions efficiently.
- **Enhancing Exceptions**: Creating custom exceptions, reflecting on errors, and enriching exception handling.
- **Chained Exceptions**: Understanding `traceback`, handling chained exceptions, and managing error information.
- **Releasing Resources with `with`**: Using the `finally` block, resource management, and syntactic sugar for cleanup operations.
- **Final Project and Conclusion**: Applying learned concepts in a final project.
