In this learning path, I learned Python programming from fundamentals to object-oriented programming. The course covered Python syntax and basic programming concepts, data types (strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets), control structures (if/else, loops, comprehensions), functions and modules, file I/O and exception handling, object-oriented programming principles (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation), special methods and operator overloading, working with Python standard library, organizing code into packages and modules, and best practices for writing clean Python code. I completed hands-on projects that reinforced concepts and built a solid foundation for Python development, preparing me for both application development and data science work.
