In this course, I learned how to build full-stack Jamstack applications using Next.js and Strapi. The course covered Jamstack architecture and its benefits, creating Next.js projects with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), setting up Strapi as a headless CMS back-end, defining content types and data models in Strapi, consuming Strapi REST and GraphQL APIs in Next.js, implementing authentication and authorization flows, building dynamic routes and pages with Next.js data fetching methods (getStaticProps, getServerSideProps), creating layouts and navigation components, and deploying Strapi to cloud providers and Next.js to Vercel/Netlify. I also learned environment variables management, webhooks, custom plugins, and best practices for building production-ready Jamstack applications.
