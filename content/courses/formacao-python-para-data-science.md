In this learning path, I completed several courses on Data Science with Python and Pandas. The course covered Python fundamentals for data science, NumPy for numerical computing and array operations, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames, Series, indexing, grouping, aggregations), data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, working with different data formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, databases), statistical analysis and descriptive statistics, and applying data science workflows to real-world datasets. I learned how to extract insights from data, handle missing values, perform transformations, and create meaningful visualizations to support data-driven decision making.
