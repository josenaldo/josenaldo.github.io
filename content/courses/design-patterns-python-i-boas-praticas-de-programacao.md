In this course, I learned:

- **Design Patterns and the Strategy Pattern**: Introduction to design patterns, motivation for their use, when to apply the Strategy pattern, and practical implementation.
- **Multiple Discounts and the Chain of Responsibility**: Using the Chain of Responsibility pattern to handle multiple discount calculations, its advantages, and integration with the Strategy pattern.
- **Similar Code and the Template Method**: Applying the Template Method pattern to structure similar taxation logic using abstract classes.
- **Composed Behaviors and the Decorator Pattern**: Implementing the Decorator pattern to dynamically extend behavior, comparing it to Chain of Responsibility, and exploring Python's built-in decorator capabilities.
- **Changing States and the State Pattern**: Managing state-dependent behavior using the State pattern, applying extra discounts conditionally.
- **Object Creation and the Builder Pattern**: Using the Builder pattern to create objects with complex initialization, comparing it to Python's built-in constructor mechanisms.
- **Executing Different Actions with the Observer Pattern**: Applying the Observer pattern to trigger multiple actions in response to an event.
- **Beyond Design Patterns**: Exploring additional design patterns for filtering, external system notifications, algorithm structuring, and contract handling.
