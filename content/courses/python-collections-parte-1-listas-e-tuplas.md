In this course, I learned:

- **Introduction to Collections and Lists**: Introduction to lists and list operations, exploring list comprehension, and handling the mutability of lists.
- **Tuples**: Exploring tuples, comparing them to lists, and using them with objects and classes. Understanding the difference between tuples and lists.
- **Polymorphism and Arrays**: Exploring lists with polymorphism, arrays using NumPy, and creating arrays with abstract methods.
- **Equality**: Understanding equality in Python and implementing the `__eq__` method for object comparison.
- **Other Built-in Functions**: Exploring built-in functions like `enumerate`, `range`, and automatic tuple unpacking.
- **Natural Order**: Basic sorting of lists and organizing data.
- **Custom Sorting**: Implementing custom sorting for objects and using the `__lt__` method to define the sorting behavior.
- **Total Sorting**: Using `functools` for complete sorting and applying best practices in sorting.
