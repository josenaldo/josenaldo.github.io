In this course, I learned the fundamentals of Apache Kafka for building event streaming applications. The course covered Kafka ecosystem components (Broker, Topic, Producer, Consumer, Zookeeper), installing and configuring Kafka locally, understanding topics, partitions, and message retention, creating and managing topics using CLI tools, producing and consuming data with hands-on Java/Python examples, consumer groups and offset management, basic broker failover and cluster concepts, and common use cases for Kafka in streaming data pipelines and event sourcing. I also learned about monitoring Kafka clusters and got a brief introduction to Kafka Connect and Schema Registry.
