- **Working with Lists**: Understanding list structures, storing guessed letters, counting occurrences, and exploring list operations.
- **Working with Tuples**: Learning about immutable sequences, differences between lists and tuples, and using tuples alongside lists.
- **Implementing Game Termination**: Setting error limits, controlling loops, using list comprehensions, and handling alternative exit strategies.
- **Reading and Writing Files**: Using the `open` function, managing file access, reading and writing words, and implementing best practices.
- **Improving Code and Presentation**: Organizing code into functions, enhancing game visuals, applying best coding practices, and exporting refactored code.
