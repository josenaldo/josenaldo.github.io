Hello, everyone! My name is Josenaldo Matos, and I'm incredibly excited to be launching my new blog, Nephro Nerd Chronicles. This first post is about how I'm embarking on a journey to return to work after a long and challenging period in my life.

I've been working in software development since 1999, and I'm passionate about creating web applications, especially using Java and JavaScript. However, my life took an unexpected turn in 2008 when I lost my kidney function and had to start hemodialysis. Through the years, I've had to overcome many obstacles, including a kidney transplant, multiple accidents, and the loss of a loved one.

Despite these challenges, I've always remained passionate about software development and have continued learning new technologies. My motivation for returning to work is twofold: I love the satisfaction of solving problems and creating useful tools, and I need to support my family and achieve our dreams.

Currently, I face some difficulties due to my health and hemodialysis schedule, but I'm determined not to let these obstacles stand in my way. My goal is to find a job that allows me to be productive, create value, and earn a good income without jeopardizing my health.

Looking ahead, I envision a future where I can provide a better life for my family and myself by creating a comfortable and productive home environment. Through hard work and determination, I believe that I can overcome the challenges I face and achieve success in both my personal and professional life.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing more about my experiences, interests, and the world of software development here on Nephro Nerd Chronicles. Stay tuned for more posts, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.

Let the adventure begin!
