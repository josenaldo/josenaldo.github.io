I saw [this LinkedIn post by Pablo Jorge Maciel](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pjmaciel_um-desabafo-sobre-a-ti-e-o-tech-recruiter-activity-7224531473201037313-_KIJ), where he vents and questions why, despite being qualified, he's still invisible to the job market. I related strongly to what he said. So I decided to write this post to share my thoughts on the subject with you.

There are two ways to get a job: hunting and farming.

I saw this definition on Twitter (_I'll never call it X_), in this thread by [@SergioRocks](https://x.com/SergioRocks/status/1811386383258272092), and I thought it was really good.

Hunting is when you actively go after work. It's when you send your resume, when you apply. It's when you network, when you go to events, when you introduce yourself. It's when you cold call, when you message on LinkedIn. It's when you interview, when you take tests. It's when you chase it down.

Farming is when you "cultivate" good relationships and reputation until the fruits start falling at your feet and you start being called, referred, and invited. Sounds good, right?

The problem is that farming takes time and considerable effort. This means we have to rely much more on hunting in the short term than on farming. This emphasis on hunting can lead to forgetting farming practices, resulting in invisibility in the job market.

## The problem with hunting

Hunting seems to offer more immediate results, but it takes a lot of work, consumes a lot of time, and the return rate is ridiculously low.

The practice of hunting can be compared to selling a product to individuals who don't know the seller: it's a numbers game and you're going to send your resume to MANY job openings. A LOT. In the hundreds. Maybe even thousands. And you'll do this knowing you'll get a pitiful return.

And why is it like this? Because the hunting sales funnel is cruel.

### The hunting sales funnel

We can say that hunting is a sales funnel. And, like any sales funnel, it has several stages and has a conversion rate. The issue here is that the hunting conversion rate, by nature, is very low.

For starters, a significant portion of job postings are ghost positions. Your resume won't even be read. There isn't even anyone on the other side. This position was created to meet a quota, to justify a budget, to create volume, or to give the impression that the company is growing. And you have no way of knowing which ones these are.

Of those remaining, the ones that aren't ghosts, you probably won't get past the ATS automated screening stage. Yes, an AI will block you, because it can't read your resume, especially if it has columns, decorations, and embellishments. In this regard, the simpler the resume layout, the better. Avoid using columns, tables, graphs, images, icons, colors, different fonts, etc. It's also recommended to use file formats easily readable by artificial intelligence systems, such as .docx or PDF. Check out [my GitHub for a resume example I use](https://github.com/josenaldo). Feel free to download and use it.

In the next stage, you fight against time. If you apply for a position that received hundreds of applications, do you really think the recruitment team, with tight deadlines and few available people, will have time to read all the selected ones? If you arrived at the end of the line, the chance of even being seen is high.

In short, your chance of finding a real position, being selected by the ATS, being seen by the recruiter, and being called for an interview is very low. And if you reach this stage, you'll still have to go through the gauntlet to prove you're good enough and better than other candidates.

### How to beat this funnel?

Patience, determination, resilience, persistence, and NUMBERS.

There's lots of advice out there, but I'll summarize here:

- Simplify your resume
- Prefer ATS-compatible file formats, like PDF
- Focus on positions well-aligned with your skills
- Give preference to:
    - more recent positions (the chance of old positions being ghosts is higher)
    - positions with fewer applications (the chance of being seen is higher)
- Apply to as many positions as possible. Keep sending resumes until your email provider starts suspecting you're trying to communicate with another planet.

There's not much way around it. If you need to find a job, you're going to have to sweat. However, while hunting is essential for an active and immediate search for opportunities, it shouldn't be the only strategy adopted.

## And farming?

So... You don't want to spend the rest of your life hunting, right?

While hunting may seem like the most straightforward strategy for entering the job market, it's important to recognize the value of farming. The latter can be seen as a long-term investment in your career. By cultivating relationships and building a solid reputation, you establish fertile ground that, over time, will bring opportunities to you more naturally and frequently. Thus, while hunting seeks immediate results, farming paves the way for future and sustainable opportunities. Therefore, let's plant!

But what exactly does 'planting' mean in the context of employability?

Think of your career as a garden that needs to be cared for and cultivated to flourish. Just like a garden, your professional trajectory doesn't grow by chance; it requires attention, planning, and continuous care.

Imagine your work is like growing food: instead of depending on sporadic hunting trips, which can be uncertain and inconsistent, you develop a fertile field. This field, carefully maintained, begins to produce food regularly, providing a sustainable and reliable source of nutrition.

How do you apply this metaphor to your professional life?

You 'plant' by building and cultivating your reputation and your network.

- **Cultivating your reputation**: This is about demonstrating your competence and reliability through consistent, high-quality work. Each successfully completed project, each positive feedback, and each innovative solution you offer are like seeds germinating in your professional field.
- **Expanding your network**: Relating to other professionals is like watering and nourishing the soil. Participating in industry events, interacting on professional social media platforms, and collaborating on projects are ways to keep your 'field' healthy and productive. Each connection is a root that deepens into the soil of your career, bringing stability and opening new paths for opportunities.

Here, patience is crucial. Just as a field doesn't produce an immediate harvest, networking and building a solid reputation take time and persistence. But once established, they provide valuable resources that can sustain your career for many years.

### Cultivating your reputation in IT

In the IT field, reputation is intangible capital, but of invaluable worth. It functions as a currency in the vast technology job market, where professionals are continuously evaluated for their competencies and integrity. Being recognized as a good professional can open doors and facilitate recommendations; on the other hand, a negative reputation can create almost insurmountable barriers.

#### Investing in building a solid reputation

- **Consistent Quality**: The foundation of a good reputation starts with the consistent delivery of quality work. In IT, this means writing clean code, properly documenting your projects, and meeting deadlines. Every detail counts when your work is under scrutiny.
- **Problem Solving**: Stand out as someone who not only identifies problems but who brings effective solutions. The ability to solve challenges creatively and efficiently is highly valued in the dynamic IT environment.
- **Continuous Learning**: The technology field is always evolving, and staying updated with the latest technologies and practices is fundamental. Participating in courses, workshops, and seminars not only expands your knowledge but also demonstrates your commitment to self-development.
- **Collaboration and Communication**: IT frequently involves teamwork. Being a team player who communicates clearly and contributes to collective success strengthens your reputation as someone reliable and collaborative.

#### Building your sphere of influence

- **Effective Networking**: Attend industry events, join professional groups, and interact on digital platforms specific to IT professionals. These spaces are ideal for demonstrating your expertise and learning from others.
- **Contributions and Participation**: Contribute to open-source projects, publish articles about your areas of expertise, and participate in discussion forums. These activities put your name in circulation within the technology community and contribute to an image of an engaged and active professional.
- **Feedback and Endorsements**: Ask for feedback regularly and accept constructive criticism. Endorsements from colleagues and superiors on platforms like LinkedIn can also validate your skills and strengthen your reputation.

Remember that building a reputation takes time and requires continuous effort. You don't need to be a digital influencer or a technology genius, but it's crucial that your peers and industry leaders trust your ability to deliver results and contribute positively. By cultivating your reputation daily, you sow the seeds for a lasting and rewarding career in IT.

### The empty field problem

Many professionals at the beginning of their careers face a common dilemma: the lack of reputation and network. Without an established work history, they find themselves in what can be described as a "catch-22" — they don't have a reputation because they don't have work, and they can't get work because they don't have a reputation.

#### Breaking the cycle

To overcome this challenge, it's crucial to understand that your reputation is intrinsically linked to your results. If traditional results aren't yet an option, you need to create opportunities for yourself.

**If you chose the academic path**

You don't go to college to make friends, but to become a qualified professional. Therefore, make the most of your academic experience.

- **Internships**: Actively seek internship opportunities, even if they're not initially paid. These are gateways to practical experience.
- **Networking at college**: Engage with colleagues and professors. Being active in academic projects and study groups can also increase your visibility.
- **Professional attitude**: Show yourself as helpful, collaborative, and reliable. The way you interact with others and your willingness to help can create a lasting impression.

**For self-taught learners**

If you went the self-taught route, start by praying for luck. And while it doesn't come, learn, produce, and participate.

- **Continuous education**: Invest in online courses, workshops, and bootcamps that offer recognizable credentials. Prioritize those that provide practical skills and portfolio projects.
- **Personal and open-source projects**: Contribute to open-source projects or develop your own projects. This not only shows your technical capability but also your initiative and passion for the field.
- **Visibility at events**: Actively participate in meetups, conferences, and IT seminars. Every interaction is an opportunity to build your network.

**For professionals between jobs**

- **Analysis and reflection**: Review your previous work experiences. Identify areas for improvement and seek resources to develop these skills.
- **Stay active**: Continue applying what you've learned and sharing your knowledge. Blogs, video tutorials, and forum participation can keep your market presence warm.
- **Networking**: Keep in touch with former colleagues, professors, and mentors. They can be valuable sources of references and future opportunities.

**For Employed Professionals**

Remember that your career is the priority, even while contributing to company goals. Each task and challenge not only advances the organization but also strengthens your professional trajectory. Take responsibility for developing your career to ensure long-term success.

Cultivate your work environment:

- **Build Relationships**: Maintain good relationships with colleagues and managers and demonstrate leadership, regardless of your position.
- **Work Ethic**: Be known for your ethics and team spirit, which can open doors to future opportunities.

Adopt continuous development:

- **Constant Education**: Invest in learning new technologies and trends, participating in relevant courses and certifications.
- **Feedback and Self-Assessment**: Request feedback regularly and use it to direct your personal development.

By implementing these practices, you not only advance in your career but also contribute significantly to the success of the team and the company.

## Conclusion

Transcending invisibility in the job market is a considerable challenge, but absolutely achievable. A well-cultivated career can become a continuous source of opportunities. For this, it's essential to invest daily in your professional development.

Cultivate, plant, and prosper in your professional trajectory, transforming each action into a step from shadow toward realization and success.

While awaiting the results of these efforts, stay active in hunting for new opportunities — pursue them with determination and tenacity, as if your life depended on it. Because, in fact, it does.
