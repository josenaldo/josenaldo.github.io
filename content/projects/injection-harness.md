## 1. Elevator Pitch

A niche full-stack product for planning EFI wiring harnesses with project management, domain constraints, and recipe generation.

## 2. Problem and Context

Manual harness planning is error-prone and hard to standardize. The project turns that workflow into a structured domain application.

## 3. Scope and Role

- End-to-end full-stack implementation.
- Authentication and persistence strategy.
- Business rules by subscription plan.

## 4. Solution Implemented

Decoupled backend/frontend architecture with APIs for project registration, harness definitions (materials/wires/connectors), and build recipe generation.

## 5. Stack and Architecture

- Backend: NestJS (Express), Prisma, SQLite, JWT.
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + Mantine.
- Domain rules: tier-based limits and capabilities (Basic/Pro/Elite).

## 6. Quality and Engineering Practices

- Clear repository structure (`backend/` and `frontend/`).
- Reproducible setup using Prisma migrations.
- Product-oriented foundation ready for future iterations.

## 7. Portfolio Relevance

Shows your ability to translate a specific operational domain into a production-style full-stack system.
