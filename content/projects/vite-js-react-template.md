## 1. Elevator Pitch

A lean starter template for launching React applications with Vite in minutes, focused on speed and developer productivity.

## 2. Problem and Context

Teams often repeat the same frontend bootstrap steps across projects. This template reduces that repetitive setup work.

## 3. Scope and Role

- Base project creation.
- Standardized script organization for dev/build/lint.
- Environment configuration pattern with `.env`.

## 4. Solution Implemented

A minimal, reusable bootstrap structure distributed via `degit` for quick project initialization.

## 5. Stack and Architecture

- JavaScript + React.
- Vite as bundler/dev server.
- ESLint and standardized project scripts.

## 6. Quality and Engineering Practices

- Setup documentation in README.
- Consistent project initialization flow.
- MIT license.

## 7. Portfolio Relevance

Highlights engineering productivity, technical standardization, and reusable tooling mindset.
