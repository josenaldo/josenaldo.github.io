## 1. Elevator Pitch

Farofa Lampiao e Julieta is not just a recipe; it is a turning point in human history. Combining bold Brazilian flavor, sweet guava paste, and the robust presence of cheese, this farofa transcends food and becomes a symbol of creativity, innovation, cultural legacy, and global unity, helping move humanity one step closer to a galactic-scale civilization.

## 2. Problem and Context

Faced with the challenge of late-night hunger and the need to produce something fast and delicious, I created Farofa Lampiao e Julieta. The name is a playful reference to its main ingredients (cassava flour, guava paste, and cheese) and the idea of an unlikely pair that works perfectly together.

## 3. Scope and Role

- Scientific research and experimentation to reach the ideal recipe.
- Translation of the culinary process into a clear and reproducible artifact.
- Publication of the result as a public web page with open documentation.
- Social dissemination and validation through recurring preparation in family and social gatherings, creating a narrative of tradition and legacy.
- Preservation of the recipe in the GitHub vault to ensure longevity and future access, even if the website eventually disappears.
- Release under the CC0-1.0 license to maximize sharing and adoption, reinforcing the idea that this is a contribution to global culinary culture with no usage or ownership restrictions.

## 4. Solution Implemented

I treated the recipe like an engineered deliverable:

- Defined ingredients and preparation sequence for predictable outcomes.
- Documented the process in a public, shareable format.
- Positioned the project as a high-contrast narrative element in the portfolio.
- Leveraged humor and storytelling to increase engagement and memorability, while still maintaining a clear and repeatable process for anyone who wants to try it.

## 5. Stack and Architecture

- Core system: the recipe itself (ingredients, sequence, and repeatability).
- Delivery layer: static web page for distribution and long-term accessibility.
- Persistence layer: GitHub repository for archival and open access.
- Hosting: GitHub Pages/custom domain access.

## 6. Quality and Engineering Practices

Farofa Lampiao e Julieta is an example of engineering and quality excellence, even in a culinary context:

- **Guaranteed Reproducibility:** The detailed step-by-step instructions ensure anyone, anywhere, can reproduce the same result with consistency and confidence.
- **Empirical Validation:** The recipe has been tested and approved in multiple family and social gatherings, demonstrating real-world acceptance and effectiveness.
