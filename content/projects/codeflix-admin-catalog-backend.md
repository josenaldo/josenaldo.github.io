description: 'A Java backend for catalog administration, organized into domain/application/infrastructure modules with focus on clean architecture and long-term maintainability.'
---

## 1. Elevator Pitch

A modular catalog backend designed for maintainability and architectural clarity in enterprise-style systems.

## 2. Problem and Context

Catalog platforms often grow quickly and become hard to maintain when responsibilities are not properly separated. This project addresses that risk with a modular structure.

## 3. Scope and Role

- Modular architecture design.
- Build and development environment setup.
- Foundation for API and testing workflows.

## 4. Solution Implemented

A multi-module codebase with explicit domain/application/infrastructure boundaries to keep business logic decoupled from implementation details.

## 5. Stack and Architecture

- Java 25 + Gradle.
- Modules: `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`.
- Libraries: Spring dependency management, Mockito, JUnit Platform, ULID, Vavr.
- Local OpenAPI/Swagger support.

## 6. Quality and Engineering Practices

- Test execution configured across modules.
- Dev Containers and Docker Compose for reproducible environments.
- Backend foundation aligned with clean architecture principles.

## 7. Portfolio Relevance

Reinforces your Senior Java profile with clear emphasis on architecture, maintainability, and engineering quality.
