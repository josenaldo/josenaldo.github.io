  "Java backend focused on catalog management, structured with domain, application, and infrastructure layers and designed for maintainable enterprise-style development."
---
Backend service for catalog administration built in Java.

Highlights:

- Strong modular structure (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`).
- API-first development with OpenAPI/Swagger support.
- Production-style tooling with Gradle, Docker Compose, and Dev Containers.
- Good fit for clean architecture and long-term maintainability practices.
