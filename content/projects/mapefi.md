  "A full-stack platform with Java/Spring backend and Next.js 15 frontend, supported by ADRs, architecture standards, and product documentation for sustainable evolution."
---
## 1. Elevator Pitch

A product-oriented full-stack platform combining a robust Java/Spring backend and a modern Next.js frontend to support continuous evolution with technical governance.

## 2. Problem and Context

The project required a strong architectural foundation to evolve features predictably while preserving code quality and alignment across frontend, backend, and domain rules.

## 3. Scope and Role

- Architectural structuring.
- Stack and technical guideline definition.
- Functional and technical documentation organization (ADRs, analysis docs, guidelines).

## 4. Solution Implemented

A layered implementation with clear separation of concerns and living documentation to support medium and long-term technical decisions.

## 5. Stack and Architecture

- Backend: Java 25, Spring Boot 3.5, JPA, Validation, Security, OpenAPI, Liquibase.
- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Mantine.
- Data: PostgreSQL strategy documented through ADRs/guidelines.
- Architecture: Clean Architecture, REST API, Problem Details error model.

## 6. Quality and Engineering Practices

- ADRs covering stack, architecture, and testing strategy.
- Backend/frontend/security/database guidelines.
- Foundation prepared for standardized development and testing.

## 7. Portfolio Relevance

A strong senior-level case for architecture leadership, technical decision-making, and disciplined full-stack project execution.
