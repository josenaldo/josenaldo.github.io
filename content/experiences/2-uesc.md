### Scientific Initiation Scholarship | State University of Santa Cruz (UESC)

#### Challenge

Develop a web-based integration platform for the Bioinformatics Laboratory to consolidate multiple laboratory systems and automate genetic sequencing data processing. The solution required handling complex XML data transformations and providing unified interface for researchers.

#### Action

- **Web Interface Development**: Built comprehensive web interface using Java SE and Java EE technologies (Servlets, JSP) to integrate various laboratory systems.
- **Data Processing Automation**: Implemented automated processing of genetic sequencing data using XML, XSLT, and XPath for data transformation and integration.
- **Development Environment**: Utilized NetBeans IDE for rapid development and maintained code quality standards.
- **System Integration**: Connected disparate laboratory systems through unified web platform.

#### Result

- Successfully delivered integrated web platform consolidating multiple Bioinformatics Laboratory systems.
- Automated genetic sequencing data processing, reducing manual effort and potential errors.
- Provided researchers with unified interface for accessing laboratory systems and data.
- Gained hands-on experience with Java EE, XML technologies, and scientific computing during undergraduate research.
