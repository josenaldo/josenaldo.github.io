### Project: Sankhya Printing Service (SPS)

#### Situation

During my time at Sankhya, the existing printing management service relied on Java Applets, a technology becoming obsolete due to browser vendor support being discontinued. This posed a significant risk to the functionality and security of the Sankhya ERP.

#### Task

My primary responsibility was to design, develop, and deploy a new printing management service (SPS - Sankhya Printing Service) that would replace the Applet-based system, ensuring compatibility, security, and improved control over printing resources.

#### Action

- Designed and implemented the SPS, a server-based printing solution, utilizing Java 8, Guice, and JUnit for testing.
Developed the front-end interface using Adobe Flex and implemented communication via RESTful APIs.
- Managed the entire lifecycle of the project, from initial design to deployment and ongoing maintenance.

#### Result

The successful deployment of the SPS eliminated the dependency on Java Applets, mitigating a critical security and compatibility risk. The new system provided centralized printing control and tracking, improving resource management and reducing potential downtime.

### Project: CTE (Electronic Transport Knowledge Document) Implementation

#### Situation

Sankhya ERP required the implementation of the CTE (Electronic Transport Knowledge Document) functionality to comply with Brazilian tax regulations and streamline transportation document management. This involved a complex integration with existing ERP modules and adherence to specific legal requirements.

#### Task

I was responsible for leading the technical implementation of the CTE functionality within the Sankhya ERP, encompassing both backend and frontend development.

#### Action

- Developed the backend logic for CTE processing using Java EE 5, including validation rules and data integration with existing ERP modules.
- Developed the frontend interface using Adobe Flex, providing a user-friendly experience for managing CTE documents.
- Collaborated with stakeholders to ensure the implementation met all legal and business requirements.
- Participated in code reviews and provided mentorship to junior developers on the project.

#### Result

The successful implementation of the CTE functionality streamlined transportation document management, enhancing compliance and operational efficiency. The system enabled accurate and timely generation of CTE documents, reducing the risk of penalties and improving the overall efficiency of the logistics process. The project was delivered on time and within budget, contributing to the overall success of the Sankhya ERP.
