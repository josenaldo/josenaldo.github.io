- I taught two courses: Introduction to Java Language and Applied Programming Logic in Java. Both courses lasted 40 hours and were successful, with 8 and 10 participants respectively. The Introduction to Java Language course covered the initial concepts of Java technology, and the Applied Programming Logic in Java course covered programming logic concepts using the Java language.
