### Senior Full Stack Developer | MedEspecialista

#### Challenge

MedEspecialista needed to maintain and modernize their medical education platform, which had an unstructured codebase that limited scalability, developer productivity, and long-term maintainability. The platform required architectural refactoring across frontend and backend components, workflow improvements, and accelerated delivery cycles to support continuous platform evolution.

#### Action

- **Platform Ownership**: Took full ownership of the platform, refactoring the codebase into a more modular, maintainable architecture across frontend and backend.
- **Frontend Modernization**: Migrated the Admin app from Create React App (JavaScript) to Vite + TypeScript, adopting React Router, Zod, and TanStack Query (React Query) with Axios to replace manual patterns with reusable hooks, improving consistency, caching, and maintainability.
- **Backend Reliability**: Enhanced the Node.js + Express backend with JWT-based authentication, BullMQ for background processing/queues, and PostgreSQL persistence via Sequelize (including legacy migration management), ensuring consistent behavior across environments.
- **Clean Architecture Initiative**: Started backend modernization by rewriting services using Clean Architecture (Domain / Application / Infrastructure), structuring business logic around Use Cases, and laying groundwork for future NestJS + TypeScript migration.
- **CI/CD & Automation**: Implemented complete staging/homologation workflow and automated releases through GitHub Actions CI/CD, reducing deployment time from ~1 hour to ~2 minutes.
- **AI-Driven Productivity**: Operationalized GitHub Copilot agents (skills/prompts/instructions) and documentation-driven workflow (Markdown) for faster implementation, automated testing, and code reviews.

#### Result

- Reduced deployment time from ~1 hour to ~2 minutes through automated CI/CD workflows.
- Reduced manual work by 97% and cut delivery lead time from ~2 weeks to ~1 week.
- Improved codebase maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity through modular architecture.
- Achieved fewer bugs and better test coverage (Jest, React Testing Library) through AI-assisted testing and code review.
- Enabled repeatable, consistent deployments across environments.
