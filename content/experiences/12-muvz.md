### Senior Full Stack Developer | Muvz

#### Challenge

A major newspaper client needed to modernize their legacy Java (EJB) services into a scalable microservices architecture using modern technologies. The project required migrating critical services, implementing event-driven integrations, and delivering modern web interfaces while ensuring on-time delivery despite initial project delays.

#### Action

- **Microservices Migration**: Led the modernization initiative by migrating legacy Java (EJB) services into 5 Spring Boot microservices using Java 17, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud OpenFeign, and Apache Kafka, improving scalability, reliability, and delivery speed.
- **Frontend Development**: Delivered modern web interfaces using TypeScript, React, Next.js, React Admin, React Hook Form, TanStack Query (React Query), and MUI, enhancing user experience and maintainability across multiple product areas.
- **Back-office Platform**: Built a centralized Back-office platform (Spring Boot + React Admin) to manage shared configurations and operational workflows across microservices, improving system governance and reducing operational overhead.
- **Kafka Adoption**: Spearheaded the adoption of Apache Kafka by leading technical discovery, building proof-of-concepts with Spring, enabling local development via Docker, and driving production readiness through collaborative architecture decisions.
- **DevOps Collaboration**: Partnered with DevOps to deploy and operate a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes, and built multiple event-driven integrations—including an email delivery microservice with logging and auditing to support reliable asynchronous communication.
- **Technical Leadership**: Provided technical leadership and mentorship by reinforcing Hexagonal Architecture, SOLID, and DDD principles throughout the team.

#### Result

- Successfully modernized the system from monolithic EJB-based application to microservices architecture, reducing maintenance costs and improving system scalability.
- Improved system performance by over 40%, with faster response times and lower latency.
- Eliminated an estimated 3-month project delay, enabling on-time delivery and stronger engineering execution.
- Empowered the team with modern software engineering practices through mentorship on Hexagonal Architecture, SOLID, and DDD.
- Delivered critical event-driven integrations (Kafka, email microservice) with production-grade reliability.
