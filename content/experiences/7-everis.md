- I worked on various projects involving Java, PHP, HTML, and Javascript, as well as database technologies such as MySQL, Oracle, and PL/SQL. I also contributed to the implementation of software development processes based on CMMI 3 and mentored less experienced team members. Additionally, I worked on a proof of concept for integrating Flex and Java for Telefônica's back-office system.
