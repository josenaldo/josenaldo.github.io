### Situation

I joined Conddiz as a Senior Full Stack Developer to support a presidential campaign focused on increasing voter engagement and candidate visibility. The candidate had limited prior exposure, requiring an innovative digital strategy to differentiate them from leading opponents. This involved developing and maintaining a complex ecosystem of applications integrated with an existing backend system based on NodeJS and Strapi.

### Task

My primary responsibility was to lead the development of three key applications – a campaign website, a gamified video app, and an interactive TV app – ensuring their functionality, scalability, and alignment with the campaign's goal of maximizing voter engagement. I was also tasked with mentoring junior developers unfamiliar with key technologies.

### Action

Analyzed and implemented the backend system using NodeJS and Strapi, overcoming challenges related to content management integration.

- Developed three front-end applications using NextJS, MUI, ReactQuery, ReactHookForms, Yup, and next-seo:
  - **Campaign Website:** Developed a high-performance website providing comprehensive information about the candidate and campaign events, optimized for SEO and user experience.
  - **Gamified Video App:** Created an engaging video app allowing users to access and share campaign videos and playlists, leveraging gamification to increase user interaction.
  - **Interactive TV App:** Built a TV app with three modes – live streaming with YouTube chat integration, live election ad broadcasts with links to the official website, and on-demand access to recorded programs with a Twitter timeline.
- Mentored three junior developers with no prior experience in NextJS, providing training on core concepts like dynamic routes and static site generation, and guiding them through integration with Strapi and MUI.

### Result

Successfully delivered all three applications on time and within budget, contributing to a significant increase in voter engagement. The campaign website received over 2 million visits with an average of 25,000 daily visitors, and with a peak of over 200,000 simultaneous accesses, the gamified video app was downloaded over 10,000 times, and the interactive TV app attracted over 10,000 viewers to live and on-demand programs. My mentorship enabled the junior developers to become proficient in NextJS and contribute effectively to the project.
