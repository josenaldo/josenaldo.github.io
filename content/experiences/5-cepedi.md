- I coordinated and instructed training programs including a Programming Formation Course (CFP) with 40 participants, where 31 were approved, and a Logic Programming course with 13 approved out of 40. I also coordinated a Java Advanced and Java for WEB training for five students, who were all hired. Additionally, I implemented tools to improve the development processes and organized mini-courses to enhance knowledge in various Java-related topics.
