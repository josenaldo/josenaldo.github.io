### Situation

I joined Digidados as a Software Architect for a critical project: the development of a comprehensive Condominium Management System. This system aimed to serve three key user groups – the property management team (managing approximately 400 condominiums in Uberlândia, Brazil), condominium residents, and condominium syndics – each with unique needs and complexities.

### Task

My primary responsibility was to define and oversee the implementation of the system architecture, ensuring it met the diverse requirements of these user groups. This included gathering requirements, designing a scalable and customizable system, and mentoring the development team.

### Action

- Gathered and analyzed requirements from users and the Project Owner, understanding the specific needs of different condominium types and user roles.
- Designed a monolithic architecture with a clear separation between backend (Java and Spring Boot, utilizing JHipster for code generation) and frontend (AngularJS) to simplify development and maintenance while ensuring seamless integration.
- Coordinated the development team using SCRUM methodologies, conducting regular planning, review, and retrospective meetings to maintain alignment and track progress.
- Mentored the team through pair programming, code reviews, and bi-weekly tech talks, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- Provided targeted training and mentorship to developers struggling with the project, creating personalized learning path with study materials, practice projects, and regular presentations to build confidence and technical skills.

### Result

The implementation of the incident management system reduced the average response time from 5 days to 1 business day, significantly improving customer satisfaction. The automated invoice generation system reduced processing time from 2 days to 3 minutes, eliminating manual errors and improving communication. The successful delivery of the system architecture enabled the company to efficiently manage a large portfolio of condominiums and provide a valuable service to residents and syndics.
