Dear Friend,

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Josenaldo de Oliveira Matos Filho, or simply Josenaldo or JOM. I have a tale to share, one that I hope will intrigue you.

You see, I am a cyborg.

Yes, a cyborg. At least, that's how I like to think of myself. I am a human who relies on machines to live. More specifically, two types of machines:

- Computers, enabling me to work and connect with the world
- Hemodialysis machines, keeping me alive

My journey began with my first software project in 1999, but it wasn't until 2003 that I truly delved into the professional realm. Since then, I've weathered the challenges of a myriad of projects and companies.

When it comes to web software, I have ventured into numerous territories. Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and other languages have shaped my experiences. I have dabbled in various frameworks, backend, frontend, and even webmaster roles (RIP webmasters!).

In addition to my work as a developer, I am an active member of the development community, having led the Java Users Group of Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro (UAIJUG) from 2009 to 2018. During that time, I participated in and organized events, lectures, and courses to promote the Java ecosystem in the region.

But then, in 2008, life dealt me a cruel hand: Chronic Kidney Disease.

In a single stroke, I lost the function of both kidneys and became dependent on hemodialysis to survive. Yet, instead of succumbing to fate, I pushed forward, attending dialysis in the morning and working tirelessly in the afternoon and evening.

My family and I made the decision to undergo a kidney transplant in 2012. My mother-in-law graciously offered her kidney, and by the end of 2013, I had a new lease on life.

However, the story doesn't end there.

In 2015, life threw another wrench in the works: transplant rejection. Back to hemodialysis, I went. (If you know me personally, you can boast of knowing a man who lost his mother-in-law's kidney).

Despite my rapidly deteriorating health, I continued working until 2016 when I was forced to focus on my well-being.

From that point forward, I can say that I have overcome obstacles. I stand strong, having only lost three kidneys and broken two legs. If life were a game, I would say I was brought here to play on hard mode. And I am a very good player.

Driven by my passion for software development and the desire to achieve financial stability for my family, I am determined to continue my career and reach my personal and professional goals.

When not working, you can find me studying new technologies or exploring new projects, immersing myself in hobbies and personal interests. I appreciate this moments, specially when I can share them with my family.

What happens next, you ask? Well, that is a story yet to be written. Should you wish to learn more? Want take your part in this story? Desire to collaborate on a project? Please feel free to email me at josenaldo@gmail.com or find me on Github and LinkedIn.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Josenaldo
Software Developer & Kidney Waster
