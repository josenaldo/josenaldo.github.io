## SUMMARY

- Senior Full Stack Engineer with 20+ years of experience building and modernizing web platforms across education, media, telecom, and marketing. Strong background in system architecture (OOP, SOLID, Design Patterns, Clean/Hexagonal Architecture) and hands-on delivery with Java (Spring Boot) and JavaScript/TypeScript (React/Next.js). Recent work includes modernizing a newspaper platform by migrating legacy EJB services into Spring Boot microservices and enabling event-driven integrations with Kafka; revitalizing a medical education platform by streamlining delivery workflows, reducing manual work by 97% and cutting deployment time from ~2 hours to ~2 minutes; and delivering a multi-app ecosystem (1 backend/3 frontends) for a high-visibility project, supporting traffic peaks of ~200k users. Comfortable working in remote, high-ownership contractor roles, collaborating closely with product and DevOps to ship production-grade systems.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### **Senior Full Stack Developer | MedEspecialista | June 2024 – Current**

- Took full ownership of maintaining and modernizing a medical education platform, refactoring a previously unstructured codebase into a more modular, maintainable architecture across frontend and backend components, improving scalability, developer productivity, and long-term maintainability.
- Modernized the frontend stack by migrating the Admin app from Create React App (JavaScript) to Vite + TypeScript, adopting React Router, Zod, and TanStack Query (React Query) (Axios-powered) to replace manual Axios + useEffect patterns with reusable hooks, improving consistency, caching, and maintainability.
- Improved backend reliability and maintainability on Node.js + Express, with JWT-based authentication, BullMQ for background processing/queues, and PostgreSQL persistence via Sequelize (including legacy/complex migration management), ensuring consistent behavior across environments and production.
- Started a backend modernization initiative by rewriting services using Clean Architecture (Domain / Application / Infrastructure), structuring business logic around Use Cases, and laying the groundwork for a future migration to NestJS + TypeScript.
- Implemented a complete staging/homologation workflow and automated releases through GitHub Actions CI/CD, reducing deployment time from ~1 hour to ~2 minutes and enabling repeatable deployments; accelerated delivery by operationalizing GitHub Copilot agents (skills/prompts/instructions) and a documentation-driven workflow (Markdown), enabling faster implementation, automated testing, and code reviews — cutting lead time from ~2 weeks to ~1 week, with fewer bugs and better test coverage (Jest, React Testing Library).

### **Senior Full Stack Developer | Muvz | October 2023 – April 2024**

- Led a modernization initiative for a major newspaper client, migrating legacy Java (EJB) services into 5 Spring Boot microservices using Java 17, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud OpenFeign, and Apache Kafka, improving scalability, reliability, and delivery speed.
- Delivered modern web interfaces using TypeScript, React, Next.js, React Admin, React Hook Form, TanStack Query (React Query), and MUI, enhancing user experience and maintainability across multiple product areas.
- Built a centralized Back-office platform (Spring Boot + React Admin) to manage shared configurations and operational workflows across microservices, improving system governance and reducing operational overhead.
- Spearheaded the adoption of Apache Kafka by leading technical discovery, building proof-of-concepts with Spring, enabling local development via Docker, and driving production readiness through collaborative architecture decisions.
- Partnered with DevOps to deploy and operate a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes, and built multiple event-driven integrations — including an email delivery microservice with logging and auditing to support reliable asynchronous communication.
- Provided technical leadership and mentorship by reinforcing Hexagonal Architecture, SOLID, and DDD, and helped eliminate an estimated 3-month project delay, enabling on-time delivery and stronger engineering execution.

### **Senior Full Stack Developer | Conddiz | March 2022 – August 2022**

- Joined remotely as a senior engineer/architect on a high-visibility project supporting a major Brazilian presidential campaign, taking ownership of frontend architecture and delivery while partnering with a DevOps/project lead responsible for infrastructure and releases (ownership without DevOps).
- Designed and delivered a scalable multi-app ecosystem with 1 backend serving 3 frontends, using Node.js, Strapi, and MySQL, including content modeling (Content Types), authentication/registration flows, and integrations across the platform.
- Built the official campaign website and two production-ready PWAs using React, Next.js, MUI, TanStack Query (React Query) + Axios, and React Hook Form, integrating with YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, and WhatsApp; supported traffic peaks of ~200k users/visitors during critical campaign moments.

### **Software Architect | Digidados | February 2015 – November 2016**

- Worked as Software Architect for the project (Condominium Management System), with responsibilities including gathering requirements from users and the Project Owner, developing the system architecture, and overseeing application construction.
- Coordinated and mentored the team, focusing on technologies like Java and the Spring ecosystem (Spring Boot, Framework, Data, Security), JavaScript, AngularJS, MySQL, and AWS (EC2 and S3) while promoting good development practices.

### **Senior Java Developer | Sankhya | November 2013 – January 2015**

- Developed a printing management service for the Sankhya ERP, replacing the previous service based on Java Applets (a discontinued technology). The new service was implemented in Java 8, Guice, and JUnit (for testing), with the front-end developed in Adobe Flex and communication via REST.
- Contributed to Sankhya ERP improvements using Java EE on the back-end and Adobe Flex on the front-end.

## COMMUNITY / LEADERSHIP

### **JUG Leader | UAIJUG – Java Users Group (Triângulo Mineiro) | July 2009 – October 2018**

- Organized and supported community events, technical talks, and training sessions to promote the Java ecosystem and knowledge sharing in the region.
